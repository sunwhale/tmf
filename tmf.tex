\begin{abstract}
In the present work, extensive experiments are performed for a popular nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 under both isothermal and thermo-mechanical loading conditions, to investigate the constitutive behavior and computational modeling. Within the framework of the Ohno-Wang cyclic plasticity a modified constitutive model is suggested to describe cyclic hardening/softening, non-proportional hardening, non-masing effect etc. observed in experiments. The implicit integration algorithm is developed and implemented into the commercial finite element code. Comparison between experiments and computations confirms that the suggested model can predict the cyclic plastic behavior under most different varying temperatures and multi-axial loading paths reasonably.

\section{Introduction}
\noindent Gas turbine components are exposed in high temperature and experience cyclic multi-axial thermo-mechanical loadings. The increasing performance requirements to modern gas turbines challenge the material operating limits. Quantified characterization of deformation and fatigue behavior of materials under realistic conditions becomes increasingly of importance for industrial application \cite{harrison1996modelling}, including variations of structure temperature, mechanical loads as well as environmental conditions. Inconel 718 is the most popular nickel-based superalloy in turbine industry. It is an oxidation- and corrosion-resistant material possessing optimal thermal and mechanical property. It is used for both rotors and casings, so that the low cycle fatigue characterization of the material is of great significance for mechanical design. The operating temperature of Inconel 718 is limited to 650 $^{\circ}$C for the life limited parts, such as discs and shafts.
A turbine suffers from high temperature low cycle fatigue (LCF) as well as thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF).
The LCF and TMF behaviors of the nickel-based superalloy are the major concern for the safety and reliability of gas turbine engines.

Predicting fatigue performance of mechanical components needs a reliable constitutive description of the material. There were numerous studies on low cycle fatigue of the nickel-based superalloy published. In the past decades, numerous constitutive models for cyclic inelasticity have been published \cite{ohno1993kinematic, Pun2014138, AbdelKarim2000225, Kang2004299}, based on the concept introduced by Armstrong and Frederick \cite{armstrong1966mathematical}. Kobayashi et al. \cite{Kobayashi2008389} and Pereira and Lerch \cite{Pereira2001715} studied Inconel 718 behavior using the Johnson-Cook constitutive relation and, however, did not take the cyclic softening behavior into account.
Bai and Wierzbicki \cite{Bai20081071} modified the classical metal plasticity by taking the dependency of the Lode angle and stress triaxiality into account, which was extended by Algarni et al.  \cite{Algarni2015140} to describe the evolution of yield surface under monotonic loading conditions. Becker and Hackenberg \cite{Becker2011596} suggested a limit surface concept and described the material behavior for a wide temperature range under monotonic and cyclic loading.
Farrahi  \cite{Farrahi2014245} applied two plasticity approaches including the spring-slider rule of Nagode and the hardening rule of Chaboche to simulate cyclic behaviors.
Ohmenh\"{a}user (2014) \cite{Ohmenhauser2014631} adopted a two-layer rheological constitutive model for cyclic thermo-mechanical loading conditions.
However, neither non-proportionality nor multi-axiality of the applied load was considered under thermo-mechanical cyclic loading conditions.
The alloy Inconel 718 exhibited a pronounced initial cyclic hardening then became continuous cyclic softening at high strain amplitudes. Experiments revealed that the conventional constitutive equations are not suitable to give correct stress and strain predictions for Inconel 718. The conventional constitutive models have to be improved to take the multi-axial, thermo-mechanical and cyclic loading conditions into account.

Zhu et al. \cite{ZHU2016} introduced a cyclic elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model for thermo-mechanically coupled problems. The model introduced the energy conservation in viscoplastic deformations and considered heating exchange due to high strain rate as well as its effects on the mechanical behavior of the material. The work is interesting for metal forming, but not related to thermo-mechanical fatigue, in which the description of materials mechanical behavior under complex loading condition is of importance. 
Development of a reliable cyclic plasticity with experimental verification is necessary for predicting thermo-mechanical fatigue performance.

The present work focuses on the multi-axial cyclic behavior and the stress relaxations of Inconel 718 at varying temperatures between 300 and 650$^{\circ}$C. Effects of non-proportional cyclic loading as well as thermo-mechanical coupling are studied. Inconel 718 was proven to be hardly influenced by the strain rate below 650$^{\circ}$C under realistic loading speed \cite{kim1988elevated, Schlesinger2017}, and the constitutive model is assumed to be rate-independent. However,  experiments reveal the complex constitutive behavior of the material, such as cyclic hardening/softening, non-proportional hardening, thermo-mechanical phase effect, non-masing effect, etc. Quantitative description of the material behavior needs a constitutive model based on the extensive experimental investigation. In the present work, a modified cyclic plasticity model is suggested for the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 under multi-axial thermo-mechanical cyclic loading conditions and can give a uniform description of the material modeling for both isothermal and thermo-mechanical fatigue loading components.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Specimen specification}
\noindent The nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 investigated in the article is manufactured by ThyssenKrupp, Germany, and provided in rods of 20mm diameter. The rods were solution-treated following the standard ASTM B637 \cite{ASTMB63716}, to remove initial effects.
The chemical compositions of the nickel-based superalloy are given in Table \ref{Tab:ChemicalCompositionofIN718}. The material shows an isotropic grain distribution. The average grain size is about 15$\rm{\mu m}$.

\label{Fig:Specimen}
\end{figure}

Specimens are illustrated in Fig. \ref{Fig:Specimen}, with the surface roughness  $R_a=0.1\rm{\mu m}$. The dimensions of specimens are in accordance with the standards ASTM E606 \cite{astm2012606} and E2207 \cite{standard2007e2207}, respectively. Specimens are manufactured by a CNC machining center, and the surfaces are polished after turning. The solid specimens are used for uniaxial tests, whereas the multi-axial fatigue tests are performed in the tubular specimens. The strain gauge lengths are 12 mm and 25 mm for the solid specimen and tubular specimens, respectively. The uniform temperature in the gage length of the specimens is generated by induction heating. Different multi-axial testing techniques are discussed in \cite{socie2000multiaxial}.

Experiments were performed in the MTS servo hydraulic test system (MTS 809) equipped with an electric resistance furnace and an induction heating system. Calibration tests confirmed that both heat systems generated comparable testing results, so that effects of heating systems can be neglected. The system is capable of applying axial and biaxial loads with temperature controlling simultaneously.

\subsection{Isothermal fatigue tests}
\noindent
The isothermal monotonic tensile tests were performed at four temperatures 20$^{\circ}$C, 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C, respectively, heated by the electric resistance furnace. The temperature deviations within the gauge length of the specimen were less than $\pm3^{\circ}$C for each given temperature. The tensile tests were performed under strain-control condition with a predetermined strain rate of $1.0\times 10^{-4}\rm{s}^{-1}$.
The material property at different temperatures is summarized in Table \ref{tab:Basic_property}.

\end{table*}%

Both uniaxial and multi-axial strain controlled isothermal low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were performed with the inductive heating device. The shape of the induction coil influences the temperature distribution of the specimen and has to be optimized from the initial form. Due to the high heat conductivity of the metal, the axial temperature distribution is generally not uniform. The coil was so optimized that the temperature deviations between the indicated and nominal values were less than $\pm3^{\circ}$C.
The specimen temperature was represented and controlled by a thermal element wrapped at the axial center of the gauge length of the specimen.
Tension-compression tests and pure torsion tests were conducted on solid and tubular specimens under strain controlling, respectively. 

%\subsubsection{Uniaxial fatigue tests}
%\noindent
Isothermal uniaxial tests were carried out with a given loading ratio $R_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon_{\min}/\varepsilon_{\max}=-1$.
A triangular waveform was applied at a prescribed frequency of 0.05 Hz over the strain range of $\pm 0.6\%$ to $\pm 1.0\%$, i.e. the strain rates were below $1.0\times 10^{-3}\rm{s}^{-1}$.
The strain peak  $\varepsilon_{\max}$ and valley $\varepsilon_{\min}$ were given to the MTS controlling software.
The default peak and valley compensation method was used to obtain an accurate feedback value.
All uniaxial fatigue tests were performed at the temperature range of 300$^{\circ}$C to 650$^{\circ}$C in total strain control by the MTS Multipurpose software (MPE).
Failure was deemed to have occurred if the peak load dropped 15\% from the stabilized peak value. The cyclic tests were broken after 50,000 cycles if no fatigue failure occurs.

The multi-axial cyclic fatigue tests involved simultaneous axial and torsional loads with a prescribed phase.
The test procedure was adapt from the standard ASTM E2207-15 which describes the strain-controlled axial and torsional fatigue test on thin-walled tubular specimens with various phase angles between axial and torsional loads under isothermal condition.
The conducted multi-axial fatigue tests are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Loading-Conditions-IF}. The loading path is described by axial strain $\varepsilon$ and the shear strain $\gamma$ in a cycle under the strain-control conditions, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}. $\varepsilon$ refers to the axial engineering strain and the engineering shear strain $\gamma$ is defined as the twist of the specimen. Under the multi-axial loading paths in Fig.  \ref{Fig:LoadPath} the path Pro is proportional, while all other three are non-proportional.

\subsection{Thermo-mechanical fatigue tests}
\noindent
Thermo-mechanical fatigue test is performed under both varying mechanical loading and thermal loading.
Changing the combination of both loads is to investigate interactions between thermal and mechanical stresses in the fatigue process and to figure out a calibration method to describe thermo-mechanical fatigue. As known, the real service load is generally not isothermal. Experiments revealed the thermo-mechanical fatigue life could be significantly shorter than the isothermal one. It becomes interesting to investigate the thermo-mechanical constitutive behavior of the material.

According to the standard ASTM E2368-10, a thermo-mechanical fatigue cycle requests uniform temperature and strain fields over the specimen gauge section which vary simultaneously and independently under given conditions. The following factors may influence experimental results:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Thermal strain}, $\varepsilon_{th}$, is induced by temperature and assumed to be linear proportional to temperature increment, $\varepsilon_{th}=\alpha \Delta T$.  It is not related to the mechanical stress.
  \item {\em Mechanical strain}, $\varepsilon_{m}$, is resulting from applied load, i.e. the mechanical stress, and directly related with the material mechanical deformation.
  \item {\em Total strain}, $\varepsilon_t$, is measured by the extensometer and denotes the sum of the thermal and mechanical strains, $\varepsilon_t=\varepsilon_m+\varepsilon_{th}$
  \item {\em Strain ratio}, $ R_{\varepsilon}=\varepsilon_{m,\min}/\varepsilon_{m,\max}$, denotes the loading ratio represented by the minimum mechanical strain over the maximum mechanical strain in a loading cycle.
  \item {\em Phase angle} of the mechanical load and thermal load, $\varphi_{T-\varepsilon}$, represents the time difference between mechanical load $\varepsilon$ and thermal load $T$.
\end{itemize}

The thermo-mechanical fatigue tests conducted in the article are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Loading-Conditions-TMF}.
In the thermo-mechanical tests, the specimen temperature varies in a triangular wave form and cycles between 300$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C. The temperature range represents the typical temperature variations in turbine components of the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718. The cooling and heating rates are 3.89$^{\circ}$C/s, which was realized in the MTS system for optimum temperature variations.  The temperature deviations from the given target value in the gauge length are between -7$^{\circ}$C and +13$^{\circ}$C as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:thermal_stability}. The mechanical loads vary in the same time interval so that the thermal and mechanical loads remain periodic.  Five thermo-mechanical loading cases of different phase angles of 0$^{\circ}$ (in-phase IP), 90$^{\circ}$ phase and 180$^{\circ}$ (out-of-phase OP) combined with different loading paths (TC, PRO, DIAM) are investigated in the article.
The thermal strain varying with temperature was determined before the TMF tests and used to calculate the mechanical strain. The thermo-mechanical loading paths should represent most complex loading condition for the constitutive investigation.


\section{The cyclic plasticity model}

\subsection{Formulation of the constitutive model}
\noindent
In the framework of the rate independent and initially isotropic plasticity, the strain rate can be additively decomposed into the elastic and plastic  part, as
\begin{equation}
\dotbfepsilon = {\dotbfepsilon}^e + {\dotbfepsilon}^{\rm p}.
\end{equation}
The elastic strain and total stress are subjected to Hooke's law,
\begin{equation}
{\dot\bfsigma} = {\mathbb{D}^e}:{\dot\bfepsilon^e},
\label{Equ:HookesLaw}
\end{equation}
where ${\mathbb{D}^e}$ is the fourth-order isotropic elastic stiffness tensor. Hereafter, $(:)$ indicates the inner product between two tensors. $(\dot{\quad})$ denotes the differentiation with respect to time.

The evolution of the plastic strain can be determined from the flow rule as
\begin{equation}
{\dotbfepsilon}^{\rm p} = \dot \lambda \frac{{\partial F}}{{\partial {\bfsigma}}}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
F = \sqrt {\frac{3}{2}\left( {\bfs - \bfa} \right):\left( {\bfs - \bfa} \right)}  - Y=0
\end{equation}
as the yield function, where $\bfs$ denotes the deviatoric part of the stress ${\bfsigma}$, the deviatoric backstress $\bfa$ describes the center of the yield surface $F$ in the deviatoric stress space, the yield stress $Y$ is the radius of the yield surface and $\dot \lambda$ is the scalar to be determined using the consistency condition $\dot F = 0$.

The backstress is the essential ingredient of the cyclic plasticity, as initially introduced by Chaboche \cite{Chaboche1986149}, as
\begin{equation}
\bfa = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {{\bfa^k}},
\end{equation}
where $M$ denotes the number of partial backstresses.

Following suggestions by D\"orring et al. \cite{Doerring2003} and Abdel Karim et al. \cite{AbdelKarim20051303}, Fang \cite{fang2015cyclic} suggested that the evolution equation of the backstress can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:dotak1}
{\dot\bfa^k} = {h^k}\frac{2}{3}{\dotbfepsilon^{\rm p}} - H\left( {{f^k}} \right){\dot \omega ^k}\frac{{{\bfa^k}}}{{{r^k}}},
\end{equation}
where ${{{h}}^k} $ and ${{{r}}^k} $ are the state variables introduced to describe cyclic plasticity of the material, $r^k$ is a function of accumulated plastic strain, i.e. ${r^k} = {r^k}\left( p \right)$.  Note no summation convention is applied for $k$. ${{{f}}^k} $ defines a series of the critical state surface in the deviatoric stress space,
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:fk}
{f^k} = \frac{3}{2}{\bfa^k}:{\bfa^k} - {\left( {{r^k}} \right)^2}.
\end{equation}
Above  $H(\cdot)$ denotes the Heaviside step function. According to Eq. (\ref{Equ:fk}), the recovery term is non-zero only when ${f^k} = 0$. In the article $r^k$ is assumed to be a function of the accumulated plastic strain and ${\dot \omega ^k}$ is derived from the consistent condition ${\dot f^k} = 0$. It follows
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Equ:dotfk}
{\dot f^k} &=& 3{\bfa^k}:{\dot\bfa^k} - 2{r^k}{\dot r^k} \\ \nonumber
&=& 3{\bfa^k}:\left[ {{h^k}\frac{2}{3}{{\dotbfepsilon}^{\rm p}} - H\left( {{f^k}} \right){{\dot \omega }^k}\frac{{{\bfa^k}}}{{{r^k}}}} \right] - 2{r^k}{\dot r^k} = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
When $H\left( {{f^k}} \right) = 1$, it results in
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:dotomegak}
{\dot \omega ^k} = {h^k}\frac{{{\bfa^k}}}{{{r^k}}}:{\dotbfepsilon^{\rm p}} - {\dot r^k}.
\end{equation}
Substituting ${\dot \omega ^k}$ into Eq. (\ref{Equ:dotak1}) follows
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Equ:dotak2}\nonumber
{\dot\bfa^k} &=& \frac{2}{3}{h^k}{\dotbfepsilon^{\rm p}} - H\left( {{f^k}} \right){h^k}\left\langle {\frac{{{\bfa^k}}}{{{r^k}}}:{{\dotbfepsilon}^{\rm p}}} \right\rangle \frac{{{\bfa^k}}}{{{r^k}}} \\
&+& H\left( {{f^k}} \right)\frac{{{\bfa^k}}}{{{r^k}}}{\dot r^k}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\left<\cdot\right>$ as the Macauley brackets.

Combining Eq. (\ref{Equ:dotak2}) with Armstrong and Frederick model as suggested by Adbel-Karim and Ohno  \cite{AbdelKarim20051303},  ${\bfa^k}$ obeys the following evolution rule, as
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Equ:dotak3}
{\dot\bfa^k} &=& {r^k}{\zeta ^k}\left[ \frac{2}{3}{{\dotbfepsilon}^{\rm p}} - {\mu ^k}\frac{\bfa^k}{r^k}\dot p \right.
\\ \nonumber
&-& \left.  H\left( {f^k} \right) \left\langle {\frac{\bfa^k}{r^k}:{\dotbfepsilon}^{\rm p}} - {\mu ^k}\dot p \right\rangle \frac{\bfa^k}{r^k} \right]
+ H\left( {f^k} \right)\frac{\bfa^k}{r^k}{\dot r^k},
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\zeta ^k}$ is the material constant related to ${h^k} = {r^k}{\zeta ^k}$. ${\mu ^k}$ is the combination parameter with $0 \leqslant {\mu ^k} \leqslant 1$. When ${\dot r^k} = 0$ and ${\mu ^k} = 0$, the modified model here is reduced to the known Ohno and Wang model. For ${\dot r^k} = 0$ and ${\mu ^k} = 1$, the  model above is reduced to the Armstrong and Frederick model. Thus, for large ${\mu ^k}$, the present model predicts more significant ratcheting and cyclic stress relaxation.


As shown by Kang \cite{Kang2004299}, it is convenient to normalize the variable $\bfa_k$ by $r^k$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:ak1}
{\bfa^k} = {r^k}{\bfb^k}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
{f^k} = \frac{3}{2}{\bfb^k}:{\bfb^k} - 1 = 0.
\end{equation}
It follows
\begin{equation}
{\dot\bfb^k} = {\zeta ^k}\left( {\frac{2}{3}{\dotbfepsilon^{\rm p}} - {\bfb^k}{{\dot p}^k}} \right) + \left[ {H\left( {{f^k}} \right) - 1} \right]\frac{{{{\dot r}^k}}}{{{r^k}}}{\bfb^k},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{\dot p^k} = \left[ {{\mu ^k} + H\left( {{f^k}} \right)\left\langle {\sqrt {\frac{3}{2}} {\bfb^k}:\bfn - {\mu ^k}} \right\rangle } \right]\dot p,
\end{equation}
where
\[\bfn = \frac{{\bfs - \bfa}}{{\left\| {\bfs - \bfa} \right\|}}
\]
is the normal direction of the yield surface. Here $\parallel\cdot\parallel$ is the Euclidean norm of a second rank tensor.


\subsection{Cyclic hardening}
\noindent
The characteristic stress-strain curve for cyclic loading is obtained from material testing subjected to alternating loads. Observations on stress-strain hysteresis loops of the austenite stainless steel showed that the peak stresses were not monotonic to plastic strain \cite{fang2015cyclic}. The steel demonstrated initial cyclic hardening behavior and then cyclic softening. Before the final failure occurs, the material showed secondary hardening. To describe such complex behavior $r^k$ should consist of two parts, $r_0^k$ and $r_{\Delta}^k$  \cite{fang2015cyclic}, that is,
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:rk1}
{r^k} = r_0^k + r_\Delta ^k,
\end{equation}
which can be identified from the monotonic tension curve and cyclic tension-compression curve, respectively.
Above $r_\Delta ^k$ is assumed to depend on the accumulated plastic strain $p$,
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:rdeltak1}
%r_\Delta ^k = r_{\Delta \rm s}^k\left[ {1 - a_1^k{e^{ - b_1^kp}} + a_2^k({e^{ - b_2^kp}} - {e^{ - b_3^kp}})} \right]
r_\Delta ^k = r_{\Delta \rm s}^k\left[ {1 - a_1^k{e^{ - b_1^kp}} - (1-a_1^k){e^{ - b_2^kp}} }\right].
\label{Equ:rdeltak}
\end{equation}
The dependence on plastic strain allows more accurate description of the cyclic hardening as well as softening behavior of the material.

\subsection{Dynamic recovery and plastic strain memorization}
\noindent
The plastic strain based memory surface proposed by Chaboche \cite{Chaboche1986149} is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:g1}
g = \sqrt {\frac{2}{3}\left( {{\bfepsilon^{\rm p}} - \bfbeta} \right):\left( {{\bfepsilon^{\rm p}} - \bfbeta} \right)}  - q,
\end{equation}
where $\bfbeta$ and $q$ represent the radius and center of the non-hardening surface, respectively.
Updating of the memory state is only available when the current plastic strain is on the surface (i.e., $g=0$), and the flow direction is outwards of the surface, that is,
\[
\frac{{\partial g}}{{\partial {\bfepsilon^{\rm p}}}}:d{\bfepsilon^{\rm p}} > 0.
\]
Above $\bfbeta$ and $q$ respectively obey the following evolution rules,
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:dotbeta1}
\dot\bfbeta  = \left( {1 - \eta } \right)H\left( g \right)\left\langle {\bfn:{\bfn^*}} \right\rangle \sqrt {\frac{3}{2}} {\bfn^*}\dot p,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:dotq1}
\dot q = \eta H\left( g \right)\left\langle {\bfn:{\bfn^*}} \right\rangle \dot p
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:nstar}
{\bfn^*} = \frac{{\partial g}}{{\partial {\bfepsilon^{\rm p}}}} = \frac{{{\bfepsilon^{\rm p}} - \bfbeta}}{{\left\| {{\bfepsilon^{\rm p}} - \bfbeta} \right\|}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Non-proportional hardening}
\noindent
In the article the non-proportional hardening is considered in an additional term of the isotropic hardening, as
\begin{equation}
Y = {Y_0} + {Y_{\Delta \rm np}},
\end{equation}
where $Y_0$ denotes the yield stress for proportional loading and ${Y_{\Delta \rm np}}$ is the non-proportional hardening defined by
\begin{equation}
{\dot Y_{\Delta \rm np}} = {\gamma _{\rm p}}\left( {{Y_{\rm \Delta nps}} - {Y_{\Delta \rm np}}} \right)\dot p.
\end{equation}
Integrating the above equation with the initial condition ${Y_{\Delta \rm np}}(0)=0$ follows
\begin{equation}
{Y_{\Delta \rm np}} = Y_{\rm \Delta nps}\left( 1-e^{- \gamma_{\rm p} p} \right),
\end{equation}
where $Y_{\rm \Delta nps}$ is the saturated value of ${Y_{\Delta \rm np}}$ under a non-proportional loading path.
Tanaka introduced a non-proportionality factor \cite{tanaka1994nonproportionality},
\begin{equation}
\phi  = \sqrt {1 - \frac{{\bfn:\mathbb{C}:\mathbb{C}:\bfn}}{{\mathbb{C}::\mathbb{C}}}}
\end{equation}
to quantify influence of the non-proportional load path to the material behavior.  $\mathbb{C}$ is a fourth-rank tensor and represents the internal dislocation structure \cite{tanaka1994nonproportionality}, as
\begin{equation}
\dot {\mathbb{C}} = {c_c}\left( {\bfn \otimes \bfn - \mathbb{C}} \right)\dot p.
\end{equation}
Assuming ${Y_{\rm \Delta nps}}$ depending on the loading path follows the simplest form as
\begin{equation}
{Y_{\rm \Delta nps}} = \phi {Y_{\Delta \rm NS}},
\end{equation}
with $0 \leq \phi \leq 1$.
For the proportional loading $\phi = 0$, there is no non-proportional hardening, while $\phi = 1$ means ${Y_{\rm \Delta nps}} = {Y_{\Delta \rm NS}}$ for the maximum non-proportional hardening.

According to Ref. \cite{fang2015cyclic}, the evolution of ${Y_{\Delta \rm NS}}$ can be defined as
\begin{equation}
{\dot Y_{\Delta \rm NS}} = {\gamma _{\rm q}}\left( {{Y_{\Delta \rm sat}} - {Y_{\Delta \rm NS}}} \right)\dot q.
\end{equation}
Noting that the strain memory effect is taken into account, $q$ is the radius of strain memory surface, ${\gamma _{\rm q}}$ is a rate parameter.
If the material satisfies the Masing postulate,  ${\gamma _{\rm q}}=0$. $Y_{\Delta \rm sat} $ denotes the saturate value of $Y_{\Delta \rm NS}$.

\subsection{Summary of the constitutive model}
\noindent
The initial Ohno-Wang model cannot describe the mechanical behavior of the Nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 in non-Masing behavior, cyclic softening and non-proportional hardening. In the proposed constitutive model, $r^k$ is suggested as the function of accumulated plastic strain (Eq. (\ref{rk})), which can reasonably describe cyclic softening, and the term $H\left( {f^k} \right)\frac{\bfa^k}{r^k}{\dot r^k}$ is used to consider the influence of ${\dot r^k}$. The Tanaka's non-proportionality factor is used to consider the non-proportional hardening behavior.

\section{Integration algorithm of the constitutive equations}
\noindent
The present constitutive model has included Tanaka non-proportional term and modified backstress equations for complex thermo-mechanical loads. The implicit algorithm of the constitutive equation becomes necessary and should provide the stress increment and the plastic strain increment, based on the given strain increment. The integration method is to be implemented into the commercial finite element codes, such as ABAQUS via the UMAT interface.
The backward Euler method is a first order implicit method popularly used in the finite element computation. Considering the integration interval from Step $n$ to Step $n+1$, variables of Step $n$ are denoted by the index $n$. The symbol $\Delta$ indicates the increment of the variable from $n$ to $n+1$. It is assumed that the strain increment can be decomposed in the current configuration, as
\begin{equation}
{\Delta\bfepsilon} = \Delta\bfepsilon^e + \Delta\bfepsilon^{\rm p}.
\end{equation}
The stress increment can be determined from the Hooke's law as
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:sigman+1}
\Delta\bfsigma= {\mathbb{D}^e}:\left( {{\Delta\bfepsilon} - \Delta\bfepsilon^{\rm p}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{D}^e$ represents the elasticity matrix, ${\mathbb{D}^e} = \kappa {\mathbf{I}} \otimes {\mathbf{I}} + 2G\mathbb{I}$ for elastically isotropic materials. Here $G$ is shear modulus and  $\kappa  = K - \frac{2}{3}G$  is Lame constant. ${\mathbf{I}}$ and $\mathbb{I}$ indicate the identity tensors of the second- and the fourth-order tensor, respectively, given in the component form as ${I_{ij}} = {\delta _{ij}}$ and ${\mathbb{I}_{ijkl}} = {\delta _{ik}}{\delta _{jl}}$ with ${\delta _{ij}}$ as Kronecker delta. $\otimes$ denotes the tensor product.

The return mapping algorithm is popular in computational plasticity, consisting of elastic prediction and plastic correction. The elastic prediction is taken as the elastic tentative stress,
\begin{equation}
{\bfsigma}^{\rm tr} = {\mathbb{D}^e}:\left( {{\bfepsilon} - \bfepsilon_n^{\rm p}} \right).
\end{equation}
The relationship between the stress at Step $n+1$  and the trial stress is given through
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:sigma1}
{{\bfsigma}^{} = {\mathbb{D}^e}:\left( {\bfepsilon^{} - \bfepsilon^{\rm p}} \right)} = {\bfsigma}^{\rm tr} - 2G\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}.
\end{equation}
Note that, because of elastic isotropy and plastic incompressibility, $\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}$ is a deviatoric tensor with ${\rm Tr}\left( {\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}} \right)=0$.
The stress deviator is given by
\begin{equation}
\bfs \equiv {\bfsigma} - \frac{1}{3}\left( {{\bfsigma}:{\mathbf{I}}} \right){\mathbf{I}} = {\mathbb{I}_{\rm d}}:{\bfsigma},
\end{equation}
where ${\mathbb{I}_{\rm d}} = \mathbb{I} - \frac{1}{3}{\mathbf{I}} \otimes {\mathbf{I}}$ is the deviatoric projection tensor.
Taking the deviatoric part of Eq. (\ref{Equ:sigma1}) follows
\begin{equation}\label{Equ:sminusa1}
{\bfs} = \bfs^{\rm tr} - 2G\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering{\includegraphics[width=9cm]{radial_return_map.pdf}}
\caption{Schematics of the two steps radial return map method.}
\label{Fig:radial_return_map}
\end{figure}

A two steps radial return map method proposed by  Kobayashi and Ohno \cite{kobayashi2002implementation} are employed for integrating the present constitutive model. The backstress is written as
\begin{equation}
{\bfa} = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\bfb^k}.
\end{equation}
Then the tentative form of the backstress is determined from
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:btrn+1}
\bfb^{k,\rm{tr}} = \bfb_n^k + \frac{2}{3}{\zeta ^k}\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the normalized backstress $\bfb^k$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:bn+1}
\bfb^k = \theta ^k\left( {\bfb_n^k + \frac{2}{3}{\zeta ^k}\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}} \right) = \theta ^k\bfb^{k,\rm{tr}},
\end{equation}
where $\theta ^k$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{Equ:thetan+1}
\theta ^k = c^k + H\left( {\bar f^k} \right)\left( {\frac{1}{{\bar b^{k,\rm{tr}}}} - c^k} \right)
\end{equation}
 and satisfies $0 < \theta ^k \leqslant 1$. Above $c^k$ and ${\bar f^k}$ are given through
\[
c^k = \frac{1}{{1 + {\zeta ^k}\mu \Delta {p} - \frac{{\Delta r^k}}{{r^k}}}},
\]
\[
\bar f^k = {\left( {c^k\bar b^{k,\rm{tr}}} \right)^2} - 1,
\]
with
\[
\bar b^{k,\rm{tr}} = \sqrt {\frac{3}{2}\bfb^{k,\rm{tr}}:\bfb^{k,\rm{tr}}}.
\]
Substituting ${\bfa}$ into Eq. (\ref{Equ:sminusa1}) follows
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Equ:sminusa2}
%\begin{aligned}
{{\bfs} - {\bfa}}&=&
\bfs^{\rm tr} - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\theta ^k\bfb_n^k}
\\ \nonumber
&-& \left( {2G + \frac{2}{3}\sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\theta ^k{\zeta ^k}} } \right)\Delta \bfepsilon^{\rm p}.
%\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}
From the yield function and the flow rule it is obtained finally
\begin{equation}
\Delta {p} = \frac{{\sqrt {\frac{3}{2}} \left\| {\bfs^{\rm tr} - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\theta ^k\bfb_n^k} } \right\| - {Y_n}}}{{{{\left( {\frac{{\partial Y}}{{\partial p}}} \right)}} + 3G + \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\theta ^k{\zeta ^k}} }}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
{\bfs} - {\bfa} = \frac{{{Y}\left( {\bfs^{\rm tr} - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\theta ^k\bfb_n^k} } \right)}}{{\sqrt {\frac{3}{2}} \left\| {\bfs^{\rm tr} - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^M {r^k\theta ^k\bfb_n^k} } \right\|}}.
\end{equation}



\section{Parameter identification}
\noindent
The model parameters can be divided into the following categories: Elastic-plastic parameters, isotropic hardening parameters, kinematic hardening parameters and cyclic hardening/softening parameters. The parameters for non-proportional loading hardening is included in the isotropic hardening.

\subsection{Determination of elastic-plastic constants}

\noindent
The elastic parameters were determined from the tensile tests directly. For the elastically isotropic material Hooke's law can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
   \bfepsilon = \frac{1}{E}(\bfsigma - \nu[\mathrm{Tr}(\bfsigma)~\mathbf{I} - \bfsigma]),
\label{Equ:HookesLawInEandNu}
\end{eqnarray}
where $E$ is  Young's modulus and $\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, depending on temperature.

By neglecting the plastic strain amplitude effect, ${\zeta ^k}$ and  $r_0^k$ can be determined using the following equations \cite{Jiang1996387, jiang1996modeling}, if no isotropic hardening is assumed,
\begin{equation}
{\zeta ^k} = \frac{1}{{\varepsilon _{\rm p}^k}},
\label{Eqn:zetak}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_0^k = \left( {\frac{{\sigma _{}^k - \sigma _{}^{k - 1}}}{{\varepsilon _{\rm p}^k - \varepsilon _{\rm p}^{k - 1}}} - \frac{{\sigma _{}^{k + 1} - \sigma _{}^k}}{{\varepsilon _{\rm p}^{k + 1} - \varepsilon _{\rm p}^k}}} \right)\varepsilon _{\rm p}^k,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^k$ and $\varepsilon_p^k( k = 0,1,2,...,M+1 )$ denote the stress and plastic strain at the $k$th point on the monotonic  stress-plastic strain curve, respectively. $\sigma^0$ is the initial yield stress related to the zero plastic strain $\varepsilon_p^0=0$. Generally, the uniaxial tensile stress-strain curve is represented in $M$ intervals.

In the constitutive model, the saturated value of $r^k$ has to be determined from the cyclic stress-strain curve, which can be obtained form the experimental stabilized hysteresis loop.
The half fatigue life cycle is assumed to be the stabilized hysteresis loop.

By combining Eqs. (\ref{Equ:rk1}) and (\ref{Equ:rdeltak1}), $r^k$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{rk}
{r^k} = r_0^k + r_{\Delta \rm s}^k\left[ {1 - a_1^k{e^{ - b_1^kp}} - (1-a_1^k){e^{ - b_2^kp}} }\right],
\end{equation}
where $r_{\Delta \rm s}^k$, $a_1^k$, $b_1^k$ and $b_2^k$ are constants and $p$ is the accumulated plastic strain.
The saturated value of $r^k$ is denoted as $r^k_{\rm s}$ and the saturated increment value of $r^k$ is denoted as $r^k_{\Delta \rm s}$.
A simple procedure for determining the material constants $r_{\Delta \rm s}^k$ was by assuming that $p$ is infinitely large,
\begin{equation}
r_{\rm s}^k=\mathop {\lim }\limits_{{\rm{p}} \to \infty } {r^k} = r_0^k + r_{\Delta \rm s}^k.
\label{Equ:rsk}
\end{equation}
Generally, when the cyclic hardening/softening is stabilized, the accumulated plastic strain is large.
Consequently, the data in the stabilized hysteresis loop can be used to determine the saturated values $r^k_{\rm s}$ and $r^k_{\Delta \rm s}$.

The calculated alternating stress-strain curve was divided into $M=9$ segments with the same plastic strain for both monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curve.  $\zeta^k$ and $r_0^k$ can be determined from monotonic tension test as suggested by Jiang and Kurath \cite{Jiang1996387}. From the calculated alternating stress-strain curve the same procedure for $\zeta^k$ and $r_0^k$ is used to determine the saturated values $r^k_{\rm s}$ and $r^k_{\Delta \rm s}$.  $r^k$ is determined from the uniaxial stabilized hysteresis loop curve following Eq. (\ref{rk}). ${\zeta ^k}$ for the cyclic stress-strain relation is the same as that for the monotonic case.

%\begin{figure}[!htp]
%\centering{\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{Determine_rsk.pdf}}
%\caption{IN718 uniaxial monotonic tensile and calculated alternating stress versus plastic strain curves used to determine the material constants $r_{\rm s}^k$ and $r_{\Delta \rm s}^k$ at 650$^{\circ}$C.}
%\label{Fig:Determine_rsk}
%\end{figure}

As discussed above, both monotonic tension curve and the stabilized alternating stress-strain curve are used for identifying the model parameters.
$r_{\Delta \rm s}^k$ is describing the deviation magnitude of the two curves and $a_{1}^k$, $b_{1}^k$ and $a_{2}^k$ are used to describe the softening rate of the material.
$a_1^k$, $b_1^k$, $b_2^k$ are determined from the history curve of the peak stress under uniaxial cyclic loading. For simplicity, the cyclic softening is assumed to be purely kinematic under uniaxial loading conditions, as introduced by Ohno et al. \cite{Ohno1993375}.
$a_{1}^k$, $b_{1}^k$ and $b_{2}^k$ are independent of $k$, i.e. all segments share the same values, $a_1, b_2$ and $b_2$.
Thus, the parameters can be determined from the cyclic stress-strain curve,
\begin{equation}
1 - \frac{{\sigma  - {\sigma _0}}}{{{\sigma _0} - {\sigma _{\min }}}} = 1 - a_1{e^{ - b_1 p}} - \left( {1 - a_1} \right){e^{ - b_2 p}}.
\end{equation}
The relation provides optimal agreement between experimental curve and model, as shown in Fig.  \ref{Fig:Fitting300C_7041_Plot}. Fang \cite{fang2015cyclic} proposed a simplified model as
\begin{equation}
r_\Delta ^k = r_{\Delta \rm s}^k\left( 1 - a_1^k{e^{ - b_1^kp}}\right).
\label{Equ:fangrdeltak}
\end{equation}
Results in Fig. \ref{Fig:Fitting300C_7041_Plot} reveal significant deviations between the two different expressions above at small plastic strain region.

$Y_{\Delta \rm NS}$, $\gamma_{\rm p}$ and $\gamma_{\rm q}$ are determined from the stabilized non-proportional cyclic stress-strain curve by a optimization algorithm.
$\mu$ and $c_c$ take the values proposed by Chaboche \cite{Chaboche1986149} and Tanaka \cite{tanaka1994nonproportionality}.

\subsection{Temperature-dependent parameters}
\noindent
In this section, the model parameters are determined under isothermal conditions.
According to isothermal uniaxial monotonic tension tests and  cyclic stress-strain hysteresis curves at different temperatures, the material constants at 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C are identified and summarized in Table \ref{tab:Basic_property} and Table \ref{tab:3} with $M=9$. 

In the present constitutive model, the parameters $\mu$, $\gamma_{\rm{p}}$, $\gamma_{\rm{q}}$, $Y_{\Delta {\rm{sat}}}$ and $c_c$ are assumed to be temperature independent, while the parameters $E$, $\nu$, $r_0^k$, $r_{\Delta \rm{s}}^k$, $a_1^k$, $b_1^k$ and $b_2^k$ are considered as the temperature dependent parameters.

The temperature dependent parameters $r_0^k$, $r_{\Delta \rm{s}}^k$, $a_1^k$, $b_1^k$ and $b_2^k$ in the present constitutive model are plotted in \ref{Fig:plot_umat_parameters}. In \ref{Fig:plot_umat_parameters}(a) and (b), the parameters $r_0^k$ and $r_{\Delta \rm{s}}^k$ show a monotonic decrease with the temperature increase. And as shown in \ref{Fig:plot_umat_parameters}(c) and (d), $a_1^k$ increases with the increasing temperature while $b_1^k$ decreases with the increasing temperature and the variation of $b_2^k$ with temperature are not monotonous.

Becker and Hackenberg \cite{Becker2011596} proposed that the temperature dependent parameters $p_T$ can be interpolated between $T_1$ and $T_2$ according to
\[p_T = {10^{{{\log }_{10}}\left[ {{p_{{T_1}}}} \right] + \frac{{{{\log }_{10}}\left[ {{p_{{T_1}}}/{p_{{T_2}}}} \right]}}{{{{\log }_{10}}\left[ {{T_2}/{T_1}} \right]}}{{\log }_{10}}\left[ {T/{T_1}} \right]}},\]
where ${{p_{{T_1}}}}$ is the parameter value at $T_1$ and ${{p_{{T_2}}}}$ is the parameter value at $T_2$.

However, in the present constitutive model, the linear relationship can be observed between the most parameters and temperature, as shown in \ref{Fig:plot_umat_parameters}. Therefore, the temperature dependence of the parameters is suggested to be linearly interpolated in intervals. For an intermediate temperature $T$, the temperature dependent parameters $p_T$ are given by
\[{p_T} = {p_{{T_1}}} + \frac{{{p_{{T_2}}} - {p_{{T_1}}}}}{{{T_2} - {T_1}}}{T}.\]

In order to verify whether the model parameters calculated by the linear interpolation method are appropriate, a tension-compression isothermal fatigue test was carried out at 400$^\circ$C with the strain range of $\pm1.0\%$.
\ref{Fig:plot_cmp_TCIF400} shows the computational stress-strain response and peak-valley stress curve at the intermediate temperature $T=400^\circ$C by using the linearly interpolated temperature dependent parameters. The computational result shows a good agreement with the experimental result. Consequently, the linear interpolation method is used in the following computations.

\label{Fig:200th_Exp_Sim}
\end{figure*}

\noindent
The constitutive model described in the previous sections has been implemented into the commercial finite element code  ABAQUS via the user-defined material model interface UMAT. 
The stress-strain hysteresis loops of the uniaxial tests are simulated and predicted by the proposed model under the symmetrical strain path.
Comparison between computational and experimental stress-strain loops is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:200th_Exp_Sim}. The uniaxial tension and torsion test can be modeled using a single axisymmetric tension-torsion element.
The figure illustrates results for first loading cycles and the 200th cycles at 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C, respectively.

The strain controlled loop consists of initial loading, unloading and reverse loading.
As shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:200th_Exp_Sim}(a), in the initial loading cycle the computational and experimental loops are in reasonable agreement, but deviations are observed during reverse plastic loading for the lower temperatures because the kinematic hardening variable $r^k$ approximates ${r_0^k}$ in the first loading loop.
Note that the kinematic hardening variable ${r_0^k}$ is obtained from monotonic tension tests and evolution of $r^k$ depends on the accumulated plastic strain $p$.
During the first reverse plastic loading, the accumulated plastic strain $p$ is small, so the first simulated stress-strain hysteresis loops are mainly based on the monotonic curve. It leads to the deviation in the computation from the experimental result.
Along with loading and unloading cycles, with the evolution of $r_{\rm s}^k$ (Eq. (\ref{Equ:rsk})), the predicted responses approach the experimental curves and the agreement of the 200th cycle becomes optimal, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:200th_Exp_Sim}(b). Since the fatigue is determined mainly by the peak and valley values, such deviations will not change fatigue life assessment.

\end{figure*}


More details from the experiments and computations reveal that the material is cyclic softening, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:Compare_PACC-PV_stress_temperature}, where the stress peak and valley values from the uniaxial cyclic tension test are summarized. The softening behavior becomes more severe as temperature increases.
As mentioned earlier, in the present constitutive relation, cyclic softening is modeled by the kinematic hardening variable $r^k$, with its saturation value $r_{\rm s}^k$ smaller than its initial value $r_0$.
The figure confirms a good agreement between experiments and the constitutive model prediction in the whole loading and unloading cycles.


The multi-axial non-proportional loading results are summarized in Fig. \ref{Fig:Circle_Exp_Sim} for the circular tension-torsion loading path CIRC under strain controlling at 300$^{\circ}$C, 550$^{\circ}$C and 650$^{\circ}$C, respectively. The cyclic stress curves are constructed by plotting the shear stress versus the tensile stress in the first cycle and the 200th cycle with the total strain amplitude of $1\%$, respectively. At 650$^{\circ}$C the computational prediction shows slight over-estimate near the maximum normal stress, while others reveal optimal agreement for both initial and cyclic loading.

The present constitutive can build different cyclic softening features. Fig. \ref{Fig:IN718_Isothermal_Axial+-1_PV_Exp_vs_Sim_1}(a) depicts the peak stress from the circular loading path at the different temperatures.
The alloy exhibits an obvious continuous cyclic softening at the higher temperature, while the cyclic softening may reach a saturation stage at low temperature. Such observation can be critical for mechanical components of high temperature.
Fig. \ref{Fig:IN718_Isothermal_Axial+-1_PV_Exp_vs_Sim_1}(a) illustrates effects of kinematic hardening variables. While the Fang's model  \cite{fang2015cyclic}  in Eq. (\ref{Equ:fangrdeltak}) disagrees with the experiment in high cycle regime, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:IN718_Isothermal_Axial+-1_PV_Exp_vs_Sim_1}(b), the present model in Eq. (\ref{Equ:rdeltak}) provides a consistent cyclic behavior in the whole loading history. One term expression of Fang cannot describe the different softening behavior properly.

To study effects of the complex non-proportional loading path, stress variations for the loading cross path CROS (Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(d)) are plotted in Fig. \ref{Fig:IN718_Isothermal_300C_7049_XPath_Exp_vs_Sim}. Symbols denote experimental record and solid curves stand for computational predictions. Due to prompt changes in the loading direction, the curves become non-symmetric. In the figure both computational results with and without non-proportional hardening term are present. The obvious disagreement between computations and experiments is observed at the stress peaks. However, the improvement of the non-proportional hardening in the model is significant, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:IN718_Isothermal_300C_7049_XPath_Exp_vs_Sim}. The non-proportional hardening term is meaningful for the constitutive modeling.

\subsection{Uniaxial thermo-mechanical fatigue tests}
\noindent
Under thermo-mechanical loading conditions, both mechanical loads as well as temperature vary, which cause different deformation and damage mechanisms in the material.
In the present section, both experimental and computational results for the varying temperature between 300 and 650$^{\circ}$C are considered. Tests are controlled by the tensile and shear strains simultaneously, by a constant given equivalent strain amplitude of 1\%. In computations the model parameters determined for the isothermal cyclic tests are used, that is, the thermo-mechanical coupling is assumed not to affect the constitutive model explicitly.

In Fig. \ref{Fig:TMF_IP} the hysteresis loops of the stabilized stress-strain cycles are shown, in which the in-phase (IP), the out-of-phase (OP) and 90$^\circ$-phase temperature loads are considered, respectively.
The IP-phase loops show similar features as those of the isothermal loading.
The stress-strain curve reveals cyclic softening, as observed in isothermal tests. Interesting is the valley stress of the IP test seems higher than the computational prediction, which is related to the thermo-mechanical effects. However, the effect seems not significant.

As soon as the temperature does not change proportionally to the mechanical load, the stress-strain loops become asymmetric, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:TMF_IP}(a).
The stress-strain loops for the stabilized cycles, i.e., $N_f$/2-th cycle, in Fig. \ref{Fig:TMF_IP}(a) confirm that the constitutive model can reasonably predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of the material properly.
Furthermore, Fig. \ref{Fig:TMF_IP}(b) shows that the peak and valley stress of the computational prediction in comparing with the experiments.
The peak stresses of all temperature loading phases, i.e., IP, OP and 90$^\circ$-phase, confirm a good agreement between the experiments and computations.
However, for all valley stresses, the experimental results are observed approximately 50 MPa lower than the predictions.
The reason is that the yield surface is assumed to be circular in the present constitutive model and the yield surface seems to stiff.
As shown by Gil \cite{Gil1998}, the yield surface of Inconel 718 is a shift to the compression direction as temperature increase from room temperature to 650$^{\circ}$C.

%The agreement between the experiments and the computations is obvious.

\subsection{Multi-axial thermo-mechanical fatigue tests}
\noindent
Multi-axial thermo-mechanical material behavior were not studied systematically in literature. Effects of multi-axial loads and temperature were not discussed. In the article both proportional loading path PRO (Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(a)) and non-proportional diamond loading path DIAM (Fig. \ref{Fig:LoadPath}(c)) are investigated. Experimental results are shown in Figs. \ref{Fig:TMF_Prop45} and \ref{Fig:TMF_Diamond}, together with computational predictions.

In both tests, the temperature varies between 300 and 650$^{\circ}$C, the equivalent mechanical strain amplitude $\varepsilon_{eq,a}=1\%$, the phase angle between axial strain and temperature is zero degree for the in-phase loading (IP).
The torsional and axial stress curve reveals cyclic softening for all tested multi-axial loading cases.
Computations were performed with the non-proportional hardening factor $Y_{\rm \Delta nps}=0$MPa and $Y_{\rm \Delta nps}=200$MPa, respectively, to demonstrate the influence of the non-proportional correction to the computational results.

As shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:TMF_Prop45}, the proportional loading case provides good agreement between the computation and experiment in the peak value distribution, while the valley values show a similar deviation as observed in isothermal loading. The shifting in the shear stress-normal stress loop is caused by the under-estimate of the compressive normal stress. Generally, computations agree with the experiments reasonably. The non-proportional hardening factor does not effect the computational results, as expected.

Under the non-proportional loading condition, the diamond loading path shows significant effects of the non-proportional hardening factor in the constitutive model, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:TMF_Diamond}. The stress loops of the first loading cycles and the stabilized cycles are illustrated in Figs. \ref{Fig:TMF_Diamond}(a) and (b), respectively. In the figures, both computational results with and without non-proportional hardening factor are illustrated. In the first loading cycle and the stabilized cycle, the non-proportional hardening factor improves computational predictions. Additional hardening due to the non-proportional loading can be described by the model.

The axial and torsional peak-valley stresses are illustrated in  Figs. \ref{Fig:TMF_Diamond}(c) and (d).
In both tests, the slight deviations between computational predictions and experiments  change after loading direction. The stress amplitude at the low temperature seems to be under-estimated in comparing with the higher temperature point. However, it is confirmed that the constitutive model can predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of the material properly.

\section{Conclusions}
\noindent
In the present paper, the multi-axial thermo-mechanical behavior of the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 has been investigated experimentally and computationally.
Based on the Ohno-Wang's model, a new constitutive model has been developed for multi-axial thermo-mechanical cyclic plasticity.
An implicit computational integration algorithm for the constitutive model has been developed and implemented into the general purpose commercial finite element code ABAQUS. The computational predictions confirm that the model can properly describe elastic-plastic mechanical behavior under most different thermo-mechanical loading conditions.
From the present experimental and computational investigation the following conclusions can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}

\item {The kinematic hardening can represent the cyclic loading and the isotropic hardening can consider the non-proportional loading path effects in the constitutive model.
Complex variations in the peak and valley stresses can be described by the kinematic hardening model reasonably. The computational predictions give a reasonable agreement to  experiments in varying temperatures.}

\item {Computations confirm the significance of the non-proportional hardening term under multi-axial loading conditions and agree with experiments under different loading conditions. The prediction of the constitutive model is reasonable under both proportional and non-proportional loadings.}

\item {The temperature-dependent material parameters are determined under isothermal conditions. The results reveal the constitutive model can approach thermo-mechanical behavior reasonably under both axial and multi-axial thermo-mechanical loadings, although the small thermo-mechanical shifting in the peak-valley seems to be considered separately.}

\item{The complex loading path may induce additional strain hardening in the compressive normal stress, which cannot be caught by the present constitutive model. To quantify this effect, more detailed experiments are necessary.}

\end{itemize}
