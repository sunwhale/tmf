Three different approaches are considered for the description of kinematic behaviour: (i) the use of independent multiyield surfaces, (ii) models with two surfaces only, (iii) the so-called ¡°nonlinear-kinematic hardening rule¡± defined by a differential equation. The thermodynamic framework from which the third approach is derived and the conditions of varying temperature are considered. Connections between the three kinds of models are pointed out. Also, some specific rules to describe cyclic hardening or cyclic softening of the material are proposed. Finally, the limits of the models considered, and the difficulties associated with their practical use and their implementation in computer codes are discussed in detail. "

The investigation was performed in a two-year, six-task, combined experimental and analytical program. The path-independent integrals for application to time-dependent crack growth were critically reviewed. The crack growth was simulated using a finite element method. The path-independent integrals were computed from the results of finite-element analyses. The ability of these integrals to correlate experimental crack growth data were evaluated under various loading and temperature conditions.

abstract = "The constitutive modeling of cyclic plasticity has made great progress durinr the past 20 years. One of the unsolved difficulties concerns the problem of ratchetting, that is, the progressive strain accumulation, cycle-by-cycle, induced by the superposition of a cyclic secondary load to a constant primary load (the mean-stress in the tension-compression case). This paper consider several special kinematic hardening rules and their properties in tension-compression. One particular rule is selected which offers a good compromise, describing both the shape of the normal cyclic stress-strain relations and the ratchetting results. A complete model is then developed including isotropic hardening, which describes fairly well the monotonic, cyclic and ratchetting behaviour of type 316 L stainless steel at room temperature. "

The motivation is twofold. First, the goal of tailoring the material microstructure to control plastic deformation and related failure processes is of great economic importance. Product development cycles have become so short that traditional empirical approaches to alloy modification are noncompetitive in the global marketplace. Second, materials selection and design for durability, which rests upon our understanding of phenomena occurring at microstructural scales as well as at the scale of structural components, is of critical importance as we head into an era where an extensive infrastructure must be maintained. Cost constraints on new systems dictate much more quantitative design and analysis procedures than in the past. Research needs are discussed in a number of key areas involving experiments and modeling, including: experiments conducted at multiple length scales of resolution; principles for multiscale modeling and scale effects in plasticity; coupling of plasticity-induced damage with texture and phase transformations; progressive cyclic deformation and failure; microstructure-scale plasticity of cast alloys and low symmetry polycrystals; and employment of massively parallel computing to determine model parameters and forms of evolution equations for internal structure variables.

Comparisons with multilayer and multisurface models are made also, resulting in a finding that the simple one in the present rules is similar to the multilayer model with total strain rate replaced by inelastic (or plastic) strain rate.

abstract = "The objective of this article is to suggest new Eulerian rate type constitutive models for isotropic finite deformation elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening etc. The main novelty of the suggested models is the use of the newly discovered logarithmic stress rate and the incorporation of a simple, natural explicit integrable-exactly rate type formulation of general hyperelasticity. Each new model is thus subjected to no incompatibility of rate type formulation for elastic behaviour with the notion of elasticity, as encountered by any other existing Eulerian rate type model for elastoplasticity or hypoelasticity. As particular cases, new Prandtl-Reuss equations for elastic-perfect plasticity and elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening, respectively, are presented for computational and practical purposes. Of them, the equations for kinematic hardening and combined isotropicšCkinematic hardening are, respectively, reduced to three uncoupled equations with respect to the spherical stress component, the shifted stress and the back-stress. The effects of finite rotation on the current strain and stress and hardening behaviour are indicated in a clear and direct manner. As illustrations, finite simple shear responses for the proposed models are studied by means of numerical integration. Further, it is proved that, among all possible (infinitely many) objective Eulerian rate type models, the proposed models are not only the first, but unique, self-consistent models of their kinds, in the sense that the rate type equation used to represent elastic behaviour is exactly integrable to really deliver an elastic relation. ?

abstract = {An experimental program has been implemented to determine small offset yield loci under axial-torsional loading at elevated temperatures. The nickel-base superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718) was chosen for study due to its common use in aeropropulsion applications. Initial and subsequent yield loci were determined for solutioned IN718 at 23, 371, and 454 C and for aged (precipitation hardened) IN718 at 23 and 649 C. The shape of the initial yield loci for solutioned and aged IN718 agreed well with the von Mises prediction. However, in general, the centers of initial yield loci were eccentric to the origin due to a strength-differential (S-D) effect that increased with temperature. Subsequent yield loci exhibited anisotropic hardening in the form of translation and distortion of the locus. This work shows that it is possible to determine yield surfaces for metallic materials at temperatures up to at least 649 C using multiple probes of a single specimen. The experimental data is first-of-its-kind for a superalloy at these very high temperatures and will facilitate a better understanding of multiaxial material response, eventually leading to improved design tools for engine designers.},

It is assumed that isotropic, as well as kinematic, hardening consists of several parts, and that each part of isotropic hardening evolves when the corresponding part of kinematic hardening is in the critical state of dynamic recovery. The extended model is capable of simulating the cyclic hardening behavior in which different characteristics of cyclic hardening appear depending on strain range. The model is verified by simulating the relatively large cyclic straining tests of 304 stainless steel at ambient temperature, in which cyclic hardening does not stabilize before rupture if strain range exceeds a certain value. The model is further verified by predicting the history dependence of cyclic hardening under incremental cyclic loading and the maximum plastic strain dependence of strain hardening in cyclic tension.

These rules have a feature that only the projection of plastic strain rate into the direction of back stress contributes to the dynamic recovery. They are in contrast with the other rules in which either/both accumulated plastic strain rate or/and plastic strain rate enters into the dynamic recovery term. In this paper, another feature, which has not been investigated by Abdel-Karim and Ohno, is introduced. Discussing this feature, characterized by decomposition of back stress into radial and tangential components, a numerical integration method based on radial-return mapping using radial components only is developed. This method consists of a trial predictor and final corrector depending on the current state of back stress and plastic strain increment. The applicability of the method is examined carefully and critically. It is shown that this method is effective and its accuracy is indistinguishable to the radial-return method for elastic-perfectly plastic materials. "

abstract = "Aubin and her coworkers conducted a unique set of experiments demonstrating the influence of loading non-proportionality on ratcheting responses of duplex stainless steel. In order to further explore their new observation, a set of experiments was conducted on stainless steel (SS) 304L under various biaxial stress-controlled non-proportional histories. This new set of data reiterated Aubin and her coworkers¡¯ observation and illustrated many new responses critical to model development and validation. Two recent and different classes of cyclic plasticity models, the modified Chaboche model proposed by Bari and Hassan and the version of the multi-mechanism model proposed by Taleb and Cailletaud, are evaluated in terms of their simulations of the \{SS304L\} non-proportional ratcheting responses. A modeling scheme for non-proportional ratcheting responses using the kinematic hardening rule parameters in addition to the conventionally used isotropic hardening rule parameter (yield surface size change) in the modified Chaboche model is evaluated. Strengths and weaknesses of the models in simulating the non-proportional ratcheting responses are identified. Further improvements of these models needed for improving the non-proportional ratcheting simulations are suggested in the paper. "

The model is extended by taking into account isotropic hardening depending on accumulated plastic strain.

The accuracy of simulations can be adjusted by changing the value of this controller parameter. It is shown that such an extension is effective and restrains activation of dynamic recovery resulting in less accumulated ratchetting strain with large values of the controller parameter.

abstract = "In this paper, a constitutive model for the unified description of rate dependent and rate independent material behavior is proposed. It is applicable to isotropic metals subjected to arbitrary thermomechanical loading conditions at small strains. The focus of the model formulation is its validity for the full range of thermal and mechanical loading conditions to be covered in an industrial context by e.g. modern aero-engine designs. Consequently, the proposed model describes the material behavior on a macroscopic level covering the full temperature range from room temperature to the upper application limit under monotonic as well as cyclic loading. Special emphasis is also put on the correct representation of the observed ratcheting behavior. The most prominent features of the model are the combined treatment of both, rate dependent, as well as rate independent inelasticity through a limit surface concept, the description of primary, secondary and tertiary creep behavior and the application of an appropriate backstress evolution equation. A fully implicit integration algorithm for the proposed model is developed and implemented in connection with uniaxial integration point drivers as well as three alternative Finite Element packages. The parameters of the proposed model can be identified based on a limited number of complex cyclic tests and monotonic creep tests. After reporting on the fitting results for such tests for the Nickel-base superalloy \{IN718\} the predictive capabilities of the proposed model are assessed for a number of isothermal and nonisothermal tests. Finally, the performance of the algorithmic implementation into the Finite Element packages is briefly addressed. "

Predicted results of the developed model agreed better with experimental results when the ratcheting strain level became higher, but the developed model overestimated the ratcheting deformation in other cases.

In the proposed model, a new fading memory stress function has been introduced in the recovery term of the kinematic hardening rule to simulate the cyclic hardening behavior of the material under strain controlled loading cycles. Evolution of the yield stress during cyclic plastic deformation process has been introduced through exponential function of accumulated plastic strain. The present formulation has demonstrated the non Masing behavior and cyclic hardening characteristic of \{SA333\} CšCMn steel material similar to the experimental observations. A number of experiments have been performed to investigate the \{LCF\} and ratcheting characteristics of the material. Material constants are derived from the experimental data. In the present paper, \{LCF\} and ratcheting phenomena have been simulated by developing a \{FEM\} model with axisymmetric round specimen and the new cyclic plasticity formulations have been incorporated in the material model. The fading memory stress function, which is dependent on the loading history, leads to better realization of cyclic hardening and ratcheting phenomenon in the transient cycles as observed from the simulation and experimental results.

abstract = "The objective of this article is to suggest new Eulerian rate type constitutive models for isotropic finite deformation elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening etc. The main novelty of the suggested models is the use of the newly discovered logarithmic stress rate and the incorporation of a simple, natural explicit integrable-exactly rate type formulation of general hyperelasticity. Each new model is thus subjected to no incompatibility of rate type formulation for elastic behaviour with the notion of elasticity, as encountered by any other existing Eulerian rate type model for elastoplasticity or hypoelasticity. As particular cases, new Prandtl-Reuss equations for elastic-perfect plasticity and elastoplasticity with isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening, respectively, are presented for computational and practical purposes. Of them, the equations for kinematic hardening and combined isotropicšCkinematic hardening are, respectively, reduced to three uncoupled equations with respect to the spherical stress component, the shifted stress and the back-stress. The effects of finite rotation on the current strain and stress and hardening behaviour are indicated in a clear and direct manner. As illustrations, finite simple shear responses for the proposed models are studied by means of numerical integration. Further, it is proved that, among all possible (infinitely many) objective Eulerian rate type models, the proposed models are not only the first, but unique, self-consistent models of their kinds, in the sense that the rate type equation used to represent elastic behaviour is exactly integrable to really deliver an elastic relation. ?
